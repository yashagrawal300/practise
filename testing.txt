Software Testing

Types:

1) Unit Testing
	
In this type of testing we write testcases for functions and smaller unit of program, basically checking for loops and arithmetic formulas or algorithms.

2) Integration Testing

Connecting all the componenets mainly done in unit testing and then testing them for desired output.

3) Regression Testing

Whenever new component is added, it needs to be sure that everything else is working fine.

4)  Alpha Testing

This is a validation testing done before shipping the codebase. Done by QA engineers.

5) Beta Testing

Software is provided to limited number of people for testing in a real-time envionment

6) System Testing 

The software is tested on different systems, it just looks for input and output without worrying about the internal working

7) Stress Testing

unfavorable conditions are given to find how system reacts.

8) Performance testing

This is also known as load testing, Major point is to figureout ru time performance and speed of the software.
